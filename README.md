## Guessing Game
A simple Python Guess the Number game implemented using the Tkinter GUI library.
This Guessing Game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
### Features
- Randomly generated target number.
- User input validation.
- Real-time feedback on the guessed number.
- Congratulations message upon successful guessing.
- Simple GUI created with Tkinter.

## Transportation Network Visualization
This Python script uses NetworkX and Matplotlib to visualize a transportation network and find the shortest path between two places using Dijkstra's algorithm.
### Features
- Graph Representation: The transportation network is represented as a graph, where places are nodes and connections between places are edges.
- Shortest Path Calculation: Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path between a specified start place and destination.
- Visualization: Matplotlib is used to create a visual representation of the transportation network, highlighting the shortest path.
- Information Display: The script provides information about the selected path, including distance, time, and fare.

## Extractive Text Summarizer
This Python script utilizes extractive summarization techniques to generate a summary from a given text file. Extractive summarization involves selecting important sentences directly from the input text to form a concise summary.
### Features
- Text Summarization: The script reads a text file, processes its content, and generates a summary by selecting the most relevant sentences.
- Cosine Similarity: Sentence similarity is calculated using cosine distance to identify relationships between sentences.
- PageRank Algorithm: The PageRank algorithm is employed to rank sentences based on their importance in the context of the entire text.

## Basic Calculator
This Python script creates a basic calculator using the Tkinter library. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
### Features
- User Interface: The calculator provides a simple user interface with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), parentheses, and an equal (=) sign.
- Calculation: Users can input mathematical expressions using the provided buttons, and the calculator evaluates and displays the result.
